I can carry out the following actions:
move a robot A from a room B to a room C
pick an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C
drop an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only move a robot A from a room B to a room C if it is the case that the robot A is at B
I can only pick an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C if it is the case that B is at C and the robot A is at C and A is free from D
I can only drop an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C if it is the case that A is carrying B to D and the robot A is at C

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I move a robot A from a room B to a room C, it is the case that the robot A is at C
Once I move a robot A from a room B to a room C, it is not the case anymore that the robot A is at B
Once I pick an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C, it is the case that A is carrying B to D
Once I pick an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C, it is not the case anymore that B is at C and it is not the case anymore that A is free from D
Once I drop an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C, it is the case that B is at C and A is free from D
Once I drop an object B with a gripper D by a robot A in a room C, it is not the case anymore that A is carrying B to D


Everything that is a room or a robot or a gripper is also a object
