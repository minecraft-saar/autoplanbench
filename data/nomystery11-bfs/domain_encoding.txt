I can carry out the following actions:
load a package A into a truck B at a location C
unload a package A from a truck B at a location C
drive a truck A from a location B to a location C with fuel cost a fuellevel E changing fuel level from a fuellevel F to a fuellevel D

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only load a package A into a truck B at a location C if it is the case that B is at C and A is at C
I can only unload a package A from a truck B at a location C if it is the case that B is at C and A is in B
I can only drive a truck A from a location B to a location C with fuel cost a fuellevel E changing fuel level from a fuellevel F to a fuellevel D if it is the case that B is connected to C and the fuel cost from E to B is C and A has a fuel level of F and the sum of D and E is F and A is at B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I load a package A into a truck B at a location C, it is the case that A is in B
Once I load a package A into a truck B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is at C
Once I unload a package A from a truck B at a location C, it is the case that A is at C
Once I unload a package A from a truck B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is in B
Once I drive a truck A from a location B to a location C with fuel cost a fuellevel E changing fuel level from a fuellevel F to a fuellevel D, it is the case that A is at C and A has a fuel level of D
Once I drive a truck A from a location B to a location C with fuel cost a fuellevel E changing fuel level from a fuellevel F to a fuellevel D, it is not the case anymore that A is at B and it is not the case anymore that A has a fuel level of F


Everything that is a location or a fuellevel or a locatable is also a object
Everything that is a package or a truck is also a locatable
