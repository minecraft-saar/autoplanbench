I can carry out the following actions:
push start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H
push end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G
pop start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H
pop end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G
push a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot H to a tank-slot I
pop a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area D to an area C with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot I to a tank-slot H

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only push start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H if it is the case that A is normal and A is not unitary and connect C to D using A and E is the first in A and B is on C and B is a product of F and E is a product of G and F may interface with G and H is the location of F in C and H is occupied
I can only push end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G if it is the case that A is being push-updated and A is not unitary and connect B to C using A and D is the last in A and D follows E and D is a product of F and G is the location of F in C and G is not occupied
I can only pop start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H if it is the case that A is normal and A is not unitary and connect C to D using A and E is the last in A and B is on D and B is a product of F and E is a product of G and F may interface with G and H is the location of F in D and H is occupied
I can only pop end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G if it is the case that A is being pop-updated and A is not unitary and connect B to C using A and D is the first in A and E follows D and G is the location of F in B and G is not occupied
I can only push a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot H to a tank-slot I if it is the case that E is the first in A and connect C to D using A and B is on C and A is unitary and B is a product of F and E is a product of G and F may interface with G and H is the location of F in C and H is occupied and I is the location of G in D and I is not occupied
I can only pop a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area D to an area C with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot I to a tank-slot H if it is the case that E is the first in A and connect C to D using A and B is on D and A is unitary and B is a product of F and E is a product of G and F may interface with G and I is the location of F in D and I is occupied and H is the location of G in C and H is not occupied

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I push start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H, it is the case that A is being push-updated and B is the first in A and E follows B and H is not occupied
Once I push start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H, it is not the case anymore that A is normal and it is not the case anymore that E is the first in A and it is not the case anymore that B is on C and it is not the case anymore that H is occupied
Once I push end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G, it is the case that A is normal and E is the last in A and D is on C and G is occupied
Once I push end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G, it is not the case anymore that A is being push-updated and it is not the case anymore that D follows E and it is not the case anymore that D is the last in A and it is not the case anymore that G is not occupied
Once I pop start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H, it is the case that A is being pop-updated and B is the last in A and B follows E and H is not occupied
Once I pop start a pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom B and a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G in a tank-slot H, it is not the case anymore that A is normal and it is not the case anymore that E is the last in A and it is not the case anymore that B is on D and it is not the case anymore that H is occupied
Once I pop end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G, it is the case that A is normal and E is the first in A and D is on B and G is occupied
Once I pop end a pipe A from an area B to an area C with a batch-atom D and a batch-atom E using a product F in a tank-slot G, it is not the case anymore that A is being pop-updated and it is not the case anymore that E follows D and it is not the case anymore that D is the first in A and it is not the case anymore that G is not occupied
Once I push a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot H to a tank-slot I, it is the case that B is the first in A and B is the last in A and H is not occupied and E is on D and I is occupied
Once I push a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area C to an area D with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot H to a tank-slot I, it is not the case anymore that E is the first in A and it is not the case anymore that E is the last in A and it is not the case anymore that B is on C and it is not the case anymore that H is occupied and it is not the case anymore that I is not occupied
Once I pop a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area D to an area C with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot I to a tank-slot H, it is the case that B is the last in A and B is the first in A and I is not occupied and E is on C and H is occupied
Once I pop a batch-atom B through an unitary pipe A from an area D to an area C with a batch-atom E using a product F and a product G from a tank-slot I to a tank-slot H, it is not the case anymore that E is the last in A and it is not the case anymore that E is the first in A and it is not the case anymore that B is on D and it is not the case anymore that I is occupied and it is not the case anymore that H is not occupied


Everything that is a pipe or a area or a product or a batch-atom or a tank-slot is also a object
