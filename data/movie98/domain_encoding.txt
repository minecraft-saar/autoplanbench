I can carry out the following actions:
rewind the movie when the counter is at two hours
rewind the movie when the counter is at a time other than two hours
reset the counter to zero
get an object A which are chips
get an object A which is a dip
get an object A which is a pop
get an object A which is cheese
get an object A which are crackers

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only rewind the movie when the counter is at two hours if it is the case that the counter is at two hours
I can only rewind the movie when the counter is at a time other than two hours if it is the case that the counter is at a time other than two hours
I can always reset the counter to zero.
I can only get an object A which are chips if it is the case that A are chips
I can only get an object A which is a dip if it is the case that A is a dip
I can only get an object A which is a pop if it is the case that A is a pop
I can only get an object A which is cheese if it is the case that A is cheese
I can only get an object A which are crackers if it is the case that A are crackers

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I rewind the movie when the counter is at two hours, it is the case that the movie is rewound
Once I rewind the movie when the counter is at a time other than two hours, it is the case that the movie is rewound
Once I rewind the movie when the counter is at a time other than two hours, it is not the case anymore that the counter is at zero
Once I reset the counter to zero, it is the case that the counter is at zero
Once I get an object A which are chips, it is the case that there are chips
Once I get an object A which is a dip, it is the case that there is dip
Once I get an object A which is a pop, it is the case that there is pop
Once I get an object A which is cheese, it is the case that there is cheese
Once I get an object A which are crackers, it is the case that there are crackers
