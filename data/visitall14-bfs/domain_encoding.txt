I can carry out the following actions:
move the robot from a place A to a place B

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only move the robot from a place A to a place B if it is the case that the robot is at A and A is connected to B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I move the robot from a place A to a place B, it is the case that the robot is at B and B has been visited
Once I move the robot from a place A to a place B, it is not the case anymore that the robot is at A


Everything that is a place is also a object
