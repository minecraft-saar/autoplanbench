I can carry out the following actions:
overcome a pain A with a pleasure B by using a food C from a planet D orbiting a planet E
feast with a pleasure A on a food B and a food C moving from a location E to a location D
succumb to a pleasure B with a pain A craving a food C transitioning harmony from an object D to an object E
drink from an object A in an object C to an object D and from an object B in an object F to an object G with an object E attacking an object D and an object F attacking an object G

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only overcome a pain A with a pleasure B by using a food C from a planet D orbiting a planet E if it is the case that A is a pain and B is a pleasure and A craves C and B craves C and C is food and B is in harmony with E and E is a planet and D orbits E and D is a planet
I can only feast with a pleasure A on a food B and a food C moving from a location E to a location D if it is the case that A craves B and B is food and A is a pleasure and B eats C and C is food and B is located in E and D attacks E
I can only succumb to a pleasure B with a pain A craving a food C transitioning harmony from an object D to an object E if it is the case that A fears B and A is a pain and B is a pleasure and B craves C and C is food and B is in harmony with D and D orbits E
I can only drink from an object A in an object C to an object D and from an object B in an object F to an object G with an object E attacking an object D and an object F attacking an object G if it is the case that A is located in C and D attacks C and E attacks D and B is located in F and F attacks G
I can only drink from an object A in an object C to an object D and from an object B in an object F to an object G with an object E attacking an object D and an object F attacking an object G if it is not the case that A is equal to B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I overcome a pain A with a pleasure B by using a food C from a planet D orbiting a planet E, it is the case that A fears B and B is in harmony with D
Once I overcome a pain A with a pleasure B by using a food C from a planet D orbiting a planet E, it is not the case anymore that A craves C and it is not the case anymore that B is in harmony with E
Once I feast with a pleasure A on a food B and a food C moving from a location E to a location D, it is the case that A craves C and B is located in D
Once I feast with a pleasure A on a food B and a food C moving from a location E to a location D, it is not the case anymore that A craves B and it is not the case anymore that B is located in E
Once I succumb to a pleasure B with a pain A craving a food C transitioning harmony from an object D to an object E, it is the case that A craves C and B is in harmony with E
Once I succumb to a pleasure B with a pain A craving a food C transitioning harmony from an object D to an object E, it is not the case anymore that A fears B and it is not the case anymore that B is in harmony with D
Once I drink from an object A in an object C to an object D and from an object B in an object F to an object G with an object E attacking an object D and an object F attacking an object G, it is the case that A is located in D and B is located in G
Once I drink from an object A in an object C to an object D and from an object B in an object F to an object G with an object E attacking an object D and an object F attacking an object G, it is not the case anymore that A is located in C and it is not the case anymore that B is located in F
