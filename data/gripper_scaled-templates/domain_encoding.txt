I can carry out the following actions:
apply the action "move" to a robot A, a room B and a room C
apply the action "pick" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D
apply the action "drop" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only apply the action "move" to a robot A, a room B and a room C if it is the case that A and B are in the relation "at-robby"
I can only apply the action "pick" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D if it is the case that B and C are in the relation "at" and A and C are in the relation "at-robby" and A and D are in the relation "free"
I can only apply the action "drop" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D if it is the case that A, B and D are in the relation "carry" and A and C are in the relation "at-robby"

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I apply the action "move" to a robot A, a room B and a room C, it is the case that A and C are in the relation "at-robby"
Once I apply the action "move" to a robot A, a room B and a room C, it is not the case anymore that A and B are in the relation "at-robby"
Once I apply the action "pick" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D, it is the case that A, B and D are in the relation "carry"
Once I apply the action "pick" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D, it is not the case anymore that B and C are in the relation "at" and it is not the case anymore that A and D are in the relation "free"
Once I apply the action "drop" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D, it is the case that B and C are in the relation "at" and A and D are in the relation "free"
Once I apply the action "drop" to a robot A, an object B, a room C and a gripper D, it is not the case anymore that A, B and D are in the relation "carry"


Everything that is a room or a robot or a gripper is also a object
