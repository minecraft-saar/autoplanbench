I can carry out the following actions:
navigate a rover A from a waypoint B to a waypoint C
sample soil at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B
sample rock at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B
drop contents from a store B of a rover A
calibrate a camera B on a rover A using an objective C at a waypoint D
take image of an objective C in a mode E using a camera D on a rover A at a waypoint B
communicate soil data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C
communicate rock data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C
communicate image data from a rover A at a waypoint E to a lander B at a waypoint F for an objective C in a mode D

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only navigate a rover A from a waypoint B to a waypoint C if it is the case that A can traverse from B to C and A is available and A is at B and B is visible to C
I can only sample soil at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B if it is the case that A is at C and C is at the soil sample and A is equipped for soil analysis and B is the store of A and B is empty
I can only sample rock at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B if it is the case that A is at C and C is at the rock sample and A is equipped for rock analysis and B is the store of A and B is empty
I can only drop contents from a store B of a rover A if it is the case that B is the store of A and B is full
I can only calibrate a camera B on a rover A using an objective C at a waypoint D if it is the case that A is equipped for imaging and B is the calibration target of C and A is at D and C is visible from D and B is on board A
I can only take image of an objective C in a mode E using a camera D on a rover A at a waypoint B if it is the case that D is calibrated with A and D is on board A and A is equipped for imaging and D supports E and C is visible from B and A is at B
I can only communicate soil data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C if it is the case that A is at D and B is at the lander E and A has soil analysis C and D is visible to E and A is available and the channel B is free
I can only communicate rock data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C if it is the case that A is at D and B is at the lander E and A has rock analysis C and D is visible to E and A is available and the channel B is free
I can only communicate image data from a rover A at a waypoint E to a lander B at a waypoint F for an objective C in a mode D if it is the case that A is at E and B is at the lander F and A has an image of C in D and E is visible to F and A is available and the channel B is free

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I navigate a rover A from a waypoint B to a waypoint C, it is the case that A is at C
Once I navigate a rover A from a waypoint B to a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that A is at B
Once I sample soil at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B, it is the case that B is full and A has soil analysis C
Once I sample soil at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B, it is not the case anymore that B is empty and it is not the case anymore that C is at the soil sample
Once I sample rock at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B, it is the case that B is full and A has rock analysis C
Once I sample rock at a waypoint C using a rover A and store in a store B, it is not the case anymore that B is empty and it is not the case anymore that C is at the rock sample
Once I drop contents from a store B of a rover A, it is the case that B is empty
Once I drop contents from a store B of a rover A, it is not the case anymore that B is full
Once I calibrate a camera B on a rover A using an objective C at a waypoint D, it is the case that B is calibrated with A
Once I take image of an objective C in a mode E using a camera D on a rover A at a waypoint B, it is the case that A has an image of C in E
Once I take image of an objective C in a mode E using a camera D on a rover A at a waypoint B, it is not the case anymore that D is calibrated with A
Once I communicate soil data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C, it is the case that the channel B is free and C communicated soil data and A is available
Once I communicate soil data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that A is available and it is not the case anymore that the channel B is free
Once I communicate rock data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C, it is the case that the channel B is free and C communicated rock data and A is available
Once I communicate rock data from a rover A at a waypoint D to a lander B at a waypoint E for a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that A is available and it is not the case anymore that the channel B is free
Once I communicate image data from a rover A at a waypoint E to a lander B at a waypoint F for an objective C in a mode D, it is the case that the channel B is free and C communicated image data to D and A is available
Once I communicate image data from a rover A at a waypoint E to a lander B at a waypoint F for an objective C in a mode D, it is not the case anymore that A is available and it is not the case anymore that the channel B is free


Everything that is a rover or a waypoint or a store or a camera or a mode or a lander or a objective is also a object
