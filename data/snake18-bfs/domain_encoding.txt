I can carry out the following actions:
move an object A to a point B and update an object C to an object D
move an object A to a point B and eat spawn at an object C and update spawn to an object D
move an object A to a point B and eat without spawning

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only move an object A to a point B and update an object C to an object D if it is the case that A is the head of the snake and A is adjacent to B and C is the tail of the snake and D is next to the snake C
I can only move an object A to a point B and update an object C to an object D if it is not the case that B is blocked and it is not the case that B is a point
I can only move an object A to a point B and eat spawn at an object C and update spawn to an object D if it is the case that A is the head of the snake and A is adjacent to B and B is a point and C is spawned and C spawns next to D
I can only move an object A to a point B and eat spawn at an object C and update spawn to an object D if it is not the case that B is blocked and it is not the case that C is equal to dummypoint
I can only move an object A to a point B and eat without spawning if it is the case that A is the head of the snake and A is adjacent to B and B is a point and dummypoint is spawned
I can only move an object A to a point B and eat without spawning if it is not the case that B is blocked

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I move an object A to a point B and update an object C to an object D, it is the case that B is blocked and B is the head of the snake and B is next to the snake A and D is the tail of the snake
Once I move an object A to a point B and update an object C to an object D, it is not the case anymore that A is the head of the snake and it is not the case anymore that C is blocked and it is not the case anymore that C is the tail of the snake and it is not the case anymore that D is next to the snake C
Once I move an object A to a point B and eat spawn at an object C and update spawn to an object D, it is the case that B is blocked and B is the head of the snake and B is next to the snake A and C is a point and D is spawned
Once I move an object A to a point B and eat spawn at an object C and update spawn to an object D, it is not the case anymore that A is the head of the snake and it is not the case anymore that B is a point and it is not the case anymore that C is spawned
Once I move an object A to a point B and eat without spawning, it is the case that B is blocked and B is the head of the snake and B is next to the snake A
Once I move an object A to a point B and eat without spawning, it is not the case anymore that A is the head of the snake and it is not the case anymore that B is a point
