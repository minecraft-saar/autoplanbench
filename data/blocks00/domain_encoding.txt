I can carry out the following actions:
pick up an object A from the table
put down an object A on the table
stack an object A on an object B
unstack an object A from an object B

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up an object A from the table if it is the case that A is clear and A is on the table and the hand is empty
I can only put down an object A on the table if it is the case that holding A
I can only stack an object A on an object B if it is the case that holding A and B is clear
I can only unstack an object A from an object B if it is the case that A is on B and A is clear and the hand is empty

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I pick up an object A from the table, it is the case that holding A
Once I pick up an object A from the table, it is not the case anymore that A is on the table and it is not the case anymore that A is clear and it is not the case anymore that the hand is empty
Once I put down an object A on the table, it is the case that A is clear and the hand is empty and A is on the table
Once I put down an object A on the table, it is not the case anymore that holding A
Once I stack an object A on an object B, it is the case that A is clear and the hand is empty and A is on B
Once I stack an object A on an object B, it is not the case anymore that holding A and it is not the case anymore that B is clear
Once I unstack an object A from an object B, it is the case that holding A and B is clear
Once I unstack an object A from an object B, it is not the case anymore that A is clear and it is not the case anymore that the hand is empty and it is not the case anymore that A is on B
