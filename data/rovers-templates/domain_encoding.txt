I can carry out the following actions:
apply the action "navigate" to a rover A, a waypoint B and a waypoint C
apply the action "sample_soil" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C
apply the action "sample_rock" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C

I can only apply the action "communicate_soil_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E if it is the case that A and D are in the relation "at" and B and E are in the relation "at_lander" and A and C are in the relation "have_soil_analysis" and D and E are in the relation "visible" and A is "available" and B is "channel_free"
I can only apply the action "communicate_rock_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E if it is the case that A and D are in the relation "at" and B and E are in the relation "at_lander" and A and C are in the relation "have_rock_analysis" and D and E are in the relation "visible" and A is "available" and B is "channel_free"
I can only apply the action "communicate_image_data" to a rover A, a lander B, an objective C, a mode D, a waypoint E and a waypoint F if it is the case that A and E are in the relation "at" and B and F are in the relation "at_lander" and A, C and D are in the relation "have_image" and E and F are in the relation "visible" and A is "available" and B is "channel_free"

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I apply the action "navigate" to a rover A, a waypoint B and a waypoint C, it is the case that A and C are in the relation "at"
Once I apply the action "navigate" to a rover A, a waypoint B and a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that A and B are in the relation "at"
Once I apply the action "sample_soil" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C, it is the case that B is "full" and A and C are in the relation "have_soil_analysis"
Once I apply the action "sample_soil" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that B is "empty" and it is not the case anymore that C is "at_soil_sample"
Once I apply the action "sample_rock" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C, it is the case that B is "full" and A and C are in the relation "have_rock_analysis"
Once I apply the action "sample_rock" to a rover A, a store B and a waypoint C, it is not the case anymore that B is "empty" and it is not the case anymore that C is "at_rock_sample"
Once I apply the action "drop" to a rover A and a store B, it is the case that B is "empty"
Once I apply the action "drop" to a rover A and a store B, it is not the case anymore that B is "full"

Once I apply the action "take_image" to a rover A, a waypoint B, an objective C, a camera D and a mode E, it is not the case anymore that D and A are in the relation "calibrated"
Once I apply the action "communicate_soil_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E, it is the case that B is "channel_free" and C is "communicated_soil_data" and A is "available"
Once I apply the action "communicate_soil_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E, it is not the case anymore that A is "available" and it is not the case anymore that B is "channel_free"
Once I apply the action "communicate_rock_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E, it is the case that B is "channel_free" and C is "communicated_rock_data" and A is "available"
Once I apply the action "communicate_rock_data" to a rover A, a lander B, a waypoint C, a waypoint D and a waypoint E, it is not the case anymore that A is "available" and it is not the case anymore that B is "channel_free"

Everything that is a rover or a waypoint or a store or a camera or a mode or a lander or a objective is also a object
