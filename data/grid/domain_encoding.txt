I can carry out the following actions:
unlock a place B from a place A using a key C with a shape D
move from a place A to a place B
pick up a key B at a place A
pick up a key B and drop a key C at a place A
put down a key B at a place A

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only unlock a place B from a place A using a key C with a shape D if it is the case that A is a place and B is a place and C is a key and D is a shape and A is connected to B and C has the shape D and B has the lock shape D and the robot is at A and B is locked and holding C
I can only move from a place A to a place B if it is the case that A is a place and B is a place and the robot is at A and A is connected to B and B is open
I can only pick up a key B at a place A if it is the case that A is a place and B is a key and the robot is at A and B is at A and the arm is empty
I can only pick up a key B and drop a key C at a place A if it is the case that A is a place and B is a key and C is a key and the robot is at A and holding C and B is at A
I can only put down a key B at a place A if it is the case that A is a place and B is a key and the robot is at A and holding B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I unlock a place B from a place A using a key C with a shape D, it is the case that B is open
Once I unlock a place B from a place A using a key C with a shape D, it is not the case anymore that B is locked
Once I move from a place A to a place B, it is the case that the robot is at B
Once I move from a place A to a place B, it is not the case anymore that the robot is at A
Once I pick up a key B at a place A, it is the case that holding B
Once I pick up a key B at a place A, it is not the case anymore that B is at A and it is not the case anymore that the arm is empty
Once I pick up a key B and drop a key C at a place A, it is the case that holding B and C is at A
Once I pick up a key B and drop a key C at a place A, it is not the case anymore that holding C and it is not the case anymore that B is at A
Once I put down a key B at a place A, it is the case that the arm is empty and B is at A
Once I put down a key B at a place A, it is not the case anymore that holding B
