I can carry out the following actions:
apply the action "pick-up" to an object A
apply the action "put-down" to an object A
apply the action "stack" to an object A and an object B
apply the action "unstack" to an object A and an object B

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only apply the action "pick-up" to an object A if it is the case that A is "clear" and A is "ontable" and "handempty"
I can only apply the action "put-down" to an object A if it is the case that A is "holding"
I can only apply the action "stack" to an object A and an object B if it is the case that B is "clear" and A is "holding"
I can only apply the action "unstack" to an object A and an object B if it is the case that A and B are in the relation "on" and A is "clear" and "handempty"

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I apply the action "pick-up" to an object A, it is the case that A is "holding"
Once I apply the action "pick-up" to an object A, it is not the case anymore that A is "clear" and it is not the case anymore that A is "ontable" and it is not the case anymore that "handempty"
Once I apply the action "put-down" to an object A, it is the case that A is "clear" and "handempty" and A is "ontable"
Once I apply the action "put-down" to an object A, it is not the case anymore that A is "holding"
Once I apply the action "stack" to an object A and an object B, it is the case that "handempty" and A is "clear" and A and B are in the relation "on"
Once I apply the action "stack" to an object A and an object B, it is not the case anymore that B is "clear" and it is not the case anymore that A is "holding"
Once I apply the action "unstack" to an object A and an object B, it is the case that A is "holding" and B is "clear"
Once I apply the action "unstack" to an object A and an object B, it is not the case anymore that A and B are in the relation "on" and it is not the case anymore that A is "clear" and it is not the case anymore that "handempty"
