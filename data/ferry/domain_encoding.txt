I can carry out the following actions:
sail from a location A to a location B
board a car A at a location B
debark a car A at a location B

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only sail from a location A to a location B if it is the case that A is not equal to B and A is a location and B is a location and A is at the ferry
I can only board a car A at a location B if it is the case that A is a car and B is a location and A is at B and B is at the ferry and the ferry is empty
I can only debark a car A at a location B if it is the case that A is a car and B is a location and A is on and B is at the ferry

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I sail from a location A to a location B, it is the case that B is at the ferry
Once I sail from a location A to a location B, it is not the case anymore that A is at the ferry
Once I board a car A at a location B, it is the case that A is on
Once I board a car A at a location B, it is not the case anymore that A is at B and it is not the case anymore that the ferry is empty
Once I debark a car A at a location B, it is the case that A is at B and the ferry is empty
Once I debark a car A at a location B, it is not the case anymore that A is on
