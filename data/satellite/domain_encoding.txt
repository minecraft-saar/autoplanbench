I can carry out the following actions:
turn a satellite A from a direction C to a direction B
switch on an instrument A on a satellite B
switch off an instrument A on a satellite B
calibrate an instrument B on a satellite A pointing at a direction C
take image of a direction B using an instrument C in a mode D on a satellite A

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only turn a satellite A from a direction C to a direction B if it is the case that A is pointing at C
I can only switch on an instrument A on a satellite B if it is the case that A is on board B and power is available for B
I can only switch off an instrument A on a satellite B if it is the case that A is on board B and power is on for A
I can only calibrate an instrument B on a satellite A pointing at a direction C if it is the case that B is on board A and B is a calibration target for C and A is pointing at C and power is on for B
I can only take image of a direction B using an instrument C in a mode D on a satellite A if it is the case that C is calibrated and C is on board A and C supports D and power is on for C and A is pointing at B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I turn a satellite A from a direction C to a direction B, it is the case that A is pointing at B
Once I turn a satellite A from a direction C to a direction B, it is not the case anymore that A is pointing at C
Once I switch on an instrument A on a satellite B, it is the case that power is on for A
Once I switch on an instrument A on a satellite B, it is not the case anymore that A is calibrated and it is not the case anymore that power is available for B
Once I switch off an instrument A on a satellite B, it is the case that power is available for B
Once I switch off an instrument A on a satellite B, it is not the case anymore that power is on for A
Once I calibrate an instrument B on a satellite A pointing at a direction C, it is the case that B is calibrated
Once I take image of a direction B using an instrument C in a mode D on a satellite A, it is the case that B has an image of D


Everything that is a satellite or a direction or a instrument or a mode is also a object
