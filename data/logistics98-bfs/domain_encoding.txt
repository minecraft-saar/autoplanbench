I can carry out the following actions:
load an object A into a truck B at a location C
load an object A into an airplane B at a location C
unload an object A from a truck B at a location C
unload an object A from an airplane B at a location C
drive a truck A from a location B to a location C within a city D
fly an airplane A from an airport B to an airport C

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only load an object A into a truck B at a location C if it is the case that A is an obj and B is a truck and C is a location and B is at C and A is at C
I can only load an object A into an airplane B at a location C if it is the case that A is an obj and B is an airplane and C is a location and A is at C and B is at C
I can only unload an object A from a truck B at a location C if it is the case that A is an obj and B is a truck and C is a location and B is at C and A is in B
I can only unload an object A from an airplane B at a location C if it is the case that A is an obj and B is an airplane and C is a location and A is in B and B is at C
I can only drive a truck A from a location B to a location C within a city D if it is the case that A is a truck and B is a location and C is a location and D is a city and A is at B and B is in the city D and C is in the city D
I can only fly an airplane A from an airport B to an airport C if it is the case that A is an airplane and B is an airport and C is an airport and A is at B

The actions have the following effects on the state:
Once I load an object A into a truck B at a location C, it is the case that A is in B
Once I load an object A into a truck B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is at C
Once I load an object A into an airplane B at a location C, it is the case that A is in B
Once I load an object A into an airplane B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is at C
Once I unload an object A from a truck B at a location C, it is the case that A is at C
Once I unload an object A from a truck B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is in B
Once I unload an object A from an airplane B at a location C, it is the case that A is at C
Once I unload an object A from an airplane B at a location C, it is not the case anymore that A is in B
Once I drive a truck A from a location B to a location C within a city D, it is the case that A is at C
