# AutoPlanBench

This repository contains the code for AutoPlanBench, a tool to convert PDDL domains and problems into natural language and to run different LLM planning approaches on them.

The [dataset](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/autoplanbench/tree/main/data) is composed of domain files from different original sources and problems are generated using the corresponding generators (see [data readme](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/autoplanbench/blob/main/data/readme.md)). For the individual licenses check the respective licenses of the original software/data. 

### Overview
This Readme contains the information needed to run the main parts of the project. More detailed information about the different options and configurations, the prompts, evaluation and additional scripts can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/LLM-planning-PDDL-domains/wiki).

## Requirements
* `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
* `pip install -e .` in the main folder of the repository
* download [fastdownward](https://www.fast-downward.org/Releases/22.12)
* get and compile [VAL](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/VAL)
* an OpenAI account (it is theoretically also possible to run other models such as llama or vicuna. However, we did not test these models on the tasks and cannot tell whether they successfully generate the formats required based on the prompts and few-shot examples from the current repository)

If running vicuna with bitsandbytes it might be necessary to manually install the transformers library from source.

Create a file `set_env.py` in the main directory and specify the environment variables for openai and the planning tools like this:
```
import os
def set_env_vars():
    os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = '[KEY]'
    os.environ['FAST_DOWNWARD'] = '[PATH]/fast-downward-22.12'
    os.environ['VAL'] = '[PATH]/VAL'
    os.environ['TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM'] = 'false'

```

## Required input files

A .pddl domain description and .pddl problem files for the domain are required as input files. Create a folder in the `data` directory with the domain name as folder name. Add the domain description to this folder and name it `domain.pddl`. The problem files should be placed in a subfolder called `orig_problems`. 

The `DATA_DIR` and `ORIG_INST_FOLDER` variables in [utils/paths.py](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/autoplanbench/blob/main/utils/paths.py) can be changed if another data directory or another name for the subfolder with the problem instances is used. Alternatively different directories can be specified when running run_autoplanbench.py

**Requirements for PDDL**<br>
The current version of AutoPlanBench covers STRIPS PDDL definitions containing the operators "AND" and "NOT" and that can include *typing* and *negative_preconditions* as requirements. 

## Running the complete Pipeline

In order to run the complete AutoPlanBench pipeline including the generation of the natural language domain descriptions, all required files and running LLM planning and evaluation run:

`python run_autoplanbench.py -d [domain_name] -n [n_instances] --p-llm [planning_llm] --nl-llm [pddl2nl_llm]`

* `domain_name`: name of the domain; needs to match the name of the subfolder in the data folder where the domain file is located
* `n_instances`: number of instances that should be processed (set to number of instances to run planning on + 1 for few-shot example)
* `planning-llm`: the name of the LLM to use for the LLM planning and for translating the natural language output back to PDDL (in order to use two different models for planning and translation follow the individual steps approach below); e.g. 'gpt-4' or 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
* `nl-llm`: the name of the LLM to use for the generation of the natural language domain descriptions and the ReAct and CoT few-shot examples (currently only chat OpenAI models are supported here; to run different models the steps of the pipeline need to be run individually)

This will run the same experiments as reported in the paper with the same parameters. In order to change the parameters, the following additional arguments can be specified.

* `data_dir`: Path to the directory with the files of the specific domain
* `prefixes`: Tuple of the prefixes that should be added to the beginning of the input and output few-shot examples. First prefix is for the input and second one for the output. We used "('', '')" for the interactive approaches and "('[STATEMENT]', '[PLAN]')" for the non-interactive ones

`python configs/create_config.py -d [domain_name] --llm [llm]`

* `domain_name`: name of the domain

* `--ms-i`, `--br-i`, `--ms-ni`, `--br-ni`, `--enc` as above

</details>

### 3. Running LLM planning

`python run_planning.py --config [config] --few-shot-id [example_id]`

* `config`: Path to the planning configuration file

Will be selected from the few-shot example directory of the specific approach; For example, if the approach is 'basic' and example_id is X then the few-shot example is read from the file DATA_DIR/domain_name/few_shot_examples_basic/basic_examples_instance-X.json

**Saving the prompts**<br>
In order to save the P-LLM and T-LLM prompt for a specific problem instance in a separate file run: <br>
`python save_prompts.py --config [config] --few-shot-id [example_id] --pl-out --tr-out`<br>
where `config` and `few-shot-id` are as described above and `pl-out` and `tr_out` are the paths to the file where the P-LLM and the T-LLM prompt gets saved respectively.
