## AutoPlanBench Dataset

This readme refers to the APB 2.0 dataset. For information about the (smaller) APB 1.0 dataset refer to the readme included in the dataset .zip folder. <br>
Information for how to open the zip folders can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/autoplanbench/wiki).

**LLM Model Versions**<br>
All LLM-generated data in APB 1.0 was generated using GPT-4 and all LLM-generated data in APB 2.0 was generated by GPT-4o


### Main Structure of the APB 2.0 Dataset

* one folder for each sub-dataset

**Instances and domains used:**
* Non-IPC datasets:
  * From Planbench: blocksworld, depot, logistics
  * Created by us: blocksworld_scaled, ferry, floortile, goldminer, grid, gripper, gripper_scaled, movie-complex, rovers, satellite, visitall, visitall_scaled
* the rest of the domains (i.e. the ones ending with digits) are IPC datasets
  * [domain_name]-bfs: include all instances from the original dataset that were solved by Breadth-First Search (30min, 8GB limit)
  * others: include all instances from the original dataset that were solved by A* with lmcut heuristic (30min, 8GB limit)


**NL Description Versions**
* [domain_name]_planbench: NL descriptions are the manually created ones from Valmeekam et al.
* [domain_name]-templates: NL descriptions were generated using a simple, template-based approach
* all other folders include only NL descriptions generated by our AutoPlanBench approach

**Few-shot Examples**
* few_shot_mappings.json: lists for each dataset the origin and name of the instance used as an few-shot example in our experiments


**Structure of Dataset Folders**

Each of the sub-folders contains the following data:
* domain.pddl: PDDL domain definition
* orig_problems: original PDDL instances
* orig_gold_plans: corresponding PDDL plans generated by Breadth-First Search 
* orig_few_shot_instance: PDDL definition of the few-shot example instance, renamed to "instance-0.pddl"
* orig_few_shot_instance_plan: shortest PDDL plan generated for the few-shot example instances by Breadth-First Search, A* with lmcut or Greedy Best First Search with ff, renamed to "instance-0_plan.txt"
* adapted_instances: same as in orig_problems but with adapted object names 
* adapted_gold_plans: same as in orig_gold_plans but with adapted object names
* instance_object_mappings.json: contains all mappings between the original object names and the adapted object names
* not_selected_by_filter: list of all problem instances not selected for the experiments (and not included in the adapted_instances folder) because e.g. they are identical to the few-shot example
* domain_description_seedX.json: NL snippets for the actions and predicates generated using the LLM with seed X
* domain_encoding.txt: NL description composed out of one of the available domain_description_seedX.json versions
* translation_examples_seedX.json: the automatically generated few-shot examples for translating NL actions from domain_description_seedX back to PDDL

**Few-shot Examples**<br>
The few_shot_mappings.json file lists for each dataset the origin and name of the instance used as the few-shot example in our experiments

The actual few-shot examples are not included in the data directory of repository itself but in the .zip folders. 

* few_shot_examples_act: few-shot examples for the Act mechanism on NL input
* few_shot_examples_act_pddl: few-shot examples for the Act mechanisms on PDDL input
* few_shot_examples_basic: few-shot examples for the Basic mechanism on NL input
* few_shot_examples_basic_pddl: few-shot examples for the Basic mechanism on PDDL input
* few_shot_examples_cot:
  * cot_example_instance-0_seedX.json: the CoT example obtained by removing the observations from the react_example_instance-0.json on NL input
* few_shot_examples_react:
  * react_template_instance-0_seedX.json: the template for a react example without the thoughts yet
  * react_example_instance-0_seedX.json: the React example based on with the LLM-generated (seed set to X) thoughts
